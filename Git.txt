What is the difference between Git and SVN?

SVN
It is centralized version control system(CVCS) where back up copy will be placed in onlly one central repository.
There is no branching strategy in SVN.You can't create branches.So no parallel development.
There is no local repository.So can't save anything locallly. Every time after writing code you need to push that code to central repository immediately to save changes.

Git:-
It is Distributed version contral system where back up copy is available in everyone's machine's local repository as well as a central repository.
We can create any no of branches as we want. So we can go in parallel development simultaneously.
Every Git repositry will have its own local repository. So we can save changes locally.At the end of our work finally, we can push code to a central repository.
